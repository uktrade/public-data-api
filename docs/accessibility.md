The Department for Business and Trade digital team is committed to making sure our online services are accessible to all users and comply with level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines – WCAG 2.1, in line with The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

In order to help us achieve and maintain our objective, we have commissioned The Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) to carry out WCAG 2.1 AA level technical compliance audits that also include extensive manual testing.

We anticipate the outcome of all tests to be complete by 16th December 2023.
