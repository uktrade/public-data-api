Datasets can contain reports. Reports are similar to tables, except that the data in reports is generated from the tables in the dataset. Reports are available to satisfy common use cases for filtered or aggregated views of the data in a dataset.

If a dataset is available as SQLite, reports are generated using SQL in the `_reports` table in the SQLite file.
