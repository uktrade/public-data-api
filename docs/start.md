Any tool that can make HTTPS requests can access the Data API. Examples are ***[curl](https://curl.se/)***, ***[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)***, or the web browser you're currently using.

For example <a href="https://data.api.trade.gov.uk/v1/datasets?format=json">https://data.api.trade.gov.uk/v1/datasets?format=json</a> will return a list of datasets.
